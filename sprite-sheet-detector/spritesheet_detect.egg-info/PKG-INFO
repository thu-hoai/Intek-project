Description: # Sprites Detection
        
        ## Introduction
        
        A [**sprite**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)>) is a small [**raster graphic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) (a **bitmap**) that represents an object such as a [character, a vehicle, a projectile, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1yBP5t-fSA)
        
        ### Sprite Sheet
        
        It is not uncommon for games to have tens to hundreds of sprites. Loading each of these as an individual image would consume a lot of memory and processing power. To help manage sprites and avoid using so many images, many games use [**sprite sheets**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crrFUYabm6E) (also known as **image sprites**).
        
        A sprite sheet consists of multiple sprites in one image. In other words, sprite sheets pack multiple sprites into a single picture. Using sprite sheet, video game developers create sprite sheet animation representing one or several animation sequences while only loading a single file:
        
        
        ### Sprite Bounding Box
        
        A frame (**bounding box**) can be used to delimit the sprite in the sprite sheet. This bounding box is defined with two 2D points `top_left` and the `bottom_right`, which their respective coordinates `x` and `y` are relative to the top-left corner of the sprite sheet's image.
        
        
        ## What the project does
        - Detect sprites packed in an image (sheet) and draw their masks and bounding boxes into a new image with the same size of the original image. <br/>
        - Present a 2D map of all the the sprites with their labels. <br/>
        
        
        ## Usage Information
        ### Prerequisites
        - Python 3.7 is required. <br/>
        ### Usage
        - Use git to clone the link `https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/sprite-sheet-hoaithu1.git` to your local directory. <br/>
        - Change the your current working directory to where you git the project. <br/>
        - Open terminal and type `pipenv install -e Pipfile` to install virtual environment. <br/>
        - For example: <br/>
        ```python
        >>> from spritesheet_detect.spriteutil import SpriteSheet
        >>> sprite_sheet = SpriteSheet('Barbarian.gif')
        >>> sprites, labels = sprite_sheet.find_sprites()
        >>> len(sprites)
        39
        >>> # Create the mask image with bounding boxes.
        >>> image = sprite_sheet.create_sprite_labels_image()
        >>> image.save('barbarian_bounding_boxes.png')
        ```
